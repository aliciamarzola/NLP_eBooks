# Natural Language Processing with e-Books in Python
This project provides a brief analysis of an e-book using Python Notebooks. The analysis includes:

Sentence and chapter identification: Automatically identifying the structure of the e-book.
Word frequency analysis: Identifying the most frequently used words.
Sentiment analysis: Analyzing the positivity and negativity of each chapter using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically leveraging sentiment intensity scoring.
The project leverages powerful Python libraries like nltk to process and analyze the text, offering insights into the linguistic patterns and emotional tone of the book.
